Note: If you are new to this blog, please be aware I have a big analogy problem that I can't shake. This is the only way knowledge can be conveyed.

First off, congrats on using GitHub. If you are a self-taught programmer like me, you are already doing better than I was when I first started to learn. Back in my day, pre-vid, I saved my code on my computer. Or even worse, directly on a CMS with no backup whatsoever. I was flying too close to the sun, and my Wix.com wings melted.

Why did I do things this way? Thats not rhetorical. I ask myself that every day. And I know the reason why. It's the same reason a lot of us make mistakes in the self-taught world. We just didn't know there was a better way to do things. We were raised by wolves, away from society. You know, that society that teaches you data structures and that you should stay consistent with how you space things. We never expected society to look at our code. We were just building stuff, and we take pride in building stuff we learnt all by ourselves.

As I continued on my self-taught journey, I went through very specific states of using GitHub. At each stage, I naively thought I was using it the correct way. And each time, I had my inner peace abruptly destroyed when I realized I was using it like an idiot. But that is the beauty of the self-taught journey. We continue to be wrong, and as a result , continue to learn. Just make sure to be wrong about the same thing only once, otherwise you aren't learning.

## Drinking straight from the milk jug

The first cardinal GitHub sin I made when I discovered the wonderful tool was pushing to main. I found the tool. I learned the basics, and decided to just start using it. I learned about this magical place called "main" that I could send all of my code to be safe forever. I thought this was the only place I could send it. Boy, was I wrong.

When I look back on it, its was kind of like a child without supervision (or a 20 something male bachelor that lives alone) drinking milk. Each time they wanted to drink milk, they would just do that. There was no middle man named "cup" to get in the way. Just their mouth and the surprisingly sharp plastic rim of the milk jug that would only draw blood every now and then. Hell, there may not even own a middle man, and drinking straight from the jug works everytime, some of the time. You will eventually spill the milk all over your face, and lose all of the contents at least once.

Now, it is fine if you spill milk if you live alone. It's also fine if you drink staight from the jug if you live alone. Eventually you won't live alone. Eventually you will be sharing that milk with others. That is when you really need to start using a cup, because it is no longer your milk. It is everyone's milk, and no one will like you if you ruin it with your gross habits.

The main branch of your repo is the milk jug. Make sure you use a branch so you can pour yourself a cup without ruining it for everyone.
